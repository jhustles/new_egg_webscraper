      "(3) This is a \"Supervised Scraper\", meaning it will mostly be automated, but you will be alerted to take action when necessary. \n",

      "(6) Lastly, you will have an option to clear out the processing folder (data scraped by each page)\n",
      "(7) If you have any issues or errors, \"PRESS CTRL + C\" to quit the program in the terminal \n",
      "Disclaimer: Newegg may ban you for a 24 - 48 hours for webscraping their data, then you may resume. \n",
