=== NewEgg.Com Laptop - Supervised Web Crawler & Scraper Beta v1.0 ===
============================================================
Scope: This project is a beta and is only built to scrape the laptop section of NewEgg.com due to limited time. 

Instructions: 

Current Date And Time: 2020-04-29_00.31.21 

(1) Go to www.newegg.com, go to the laptop section, select your requirements (e.g. brand, screensize, and specifications - SSD size, processor brand and etc...) 
(2) Copy and paste the url from your exact search when prompted 
(3) This is a "Supervised Scraper", meaning it will mostly be automated, but you will be alerted to take action when necessary. 

(4) You may run the program in the background after the initial set of instructions, as the program will alert you to take action (e.g. when Newegg suspects a bot. )
(5) After the webscraping is successful, you will have an option to concatenate all of the pages you scraped together into one csv file
(6) Lastly, you will have an option to clear out the processing folder (data scraped by each page)
(7) If you have any issues or errors, "PRESS CTRL + C" to quit the program in the terminal 
Disclaimer: Newegg may ban you for a 24 - 48 hours for webscraping their data, then you may resume. 
 Also, please consider executing during the day, with tons of web traffic to their site in your respective area. 

Happy Scraping!
Please copy and paste your laptop query that you want to webscrape, and press enter:
